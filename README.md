# sslide

[sent](https://tools.suckless.org/sent/) inspired presentation tool.

This tool was created because I love sent,
but it's a bit too plain (no multiple image, image+text)
and it only support Unix (more specifically, unix running X11)

### Features:
- Multiple **frames** per page
- Custom frame location and size
- Auto content resizing
- Image support
- custom font by creating $HOME/.sslide.json ($USERPROFILE/.sslide.json on windows)

### Non-Features:
- pdf exporting - you can set up a script press k and screenshot
