More simple, More powerful

@

;f
Each page of slide contain arbitary number of frames

@

;f
A frame might be "Image frame" or "Text Frame"

@

;f
An Image frame can contain one image
A text frame can contain one paragraph of text

@

;f
Each frame must be given a "geometry"
in format ;x;y;w;h 
Every value is calculated in proportion to window size.

@

;f
For example
 ;10;20;30;30
Mean "make a frame at 10% from the left
20% from the top, 
width and height = 30%"
Or use ;f as shorthand for ;0;0;100;100

@

;0;10;100;30
Example of multi-frame page

;0;60;50;30
Frame 2

;50;60;50;30
Frame 3

@

;f
Each frame is strictly terminated by an empty line,
so if you want to have empty line in your paragraph
 
like this
 
just make it a line with one space

@

;f
Each page is terminated by a line starting with @
This line is put at the end, not at the start of the page

@

;f
Images

@

;0;0;100;50
You can make an image frame by using % symbol, followed by file path
such as %nyan.png
 
Image will be automatically resized to respect original ratio, while
fitting in the frame.
